# Simple-Cmd-WallpaperManager
Sorts and manages wallpapers along with original versions of them.
Written in .NET Core, so should run on any supported platform.

All paths the program uses are currently hard coded. I may add a configuration file in the future.
This is only a small project for personal use. If there is someone else interessted in using it, just write me.

Each wallpaper has
* A unique franchise it belongs to. (E.g. 
* An consecutive index that is unique within the same franchise.
* Each franchise belongs to a unique type. (E.g. Anime, Artists, Games, etc)

This aplication can:
* Show wallpaper stats
* Merge wallpapers
* Sort in new wallpapers
* Sort out original files without a wallpaper file.
* Fix all wallpaper indexes
